## Assignment 1: assess model validity

##### [1] Why is it best practice to plot the median for the experimental data? Explain in your report

The median is less senstive for possible outliers. If a certain value is very high or very low this does not affect the value of the median. When compared to the mean, for example, this does get affected by an outlier.

##### [2] How do the results of the simulations depend on the dose and concentration of the drug? Compare the model variables mRNA, R with the experimental data by running the simulations adjusting dosis D and plot these to find the answer.

mRNAr: The concentration of mRNAr is influenced by the MPL concentration. When a lower MPL concentration is used the mRNAr is decreasing slower. The DR(N) affects the mRNAr synthesis, this DR(N) concentration is lower when there is less MPL and therefore the mRNAr does not decrease as much. When a higher dosis is used the mRNAr is decreasing more rapidly and a lower end concentration at equilibrium can be seen. This is becuase the medicine can bind to more receptors, which results in more DR and therefore more DR(N). The IC50 value is reached earlier and the mRNAr concentration gets decreased.


R: The R concentration decreases less when using a lower MPL concentration. This is due to the fact that there is less MPL to create a MPL-receptor complex, so the R concentration stays high. The opposite can be seen when using a higher MPL concentration. The receptor concentration decreases very fast and has a lower end concentration. This is because there is more medicine to bind to the receptor, resulting in a lower receptor concentration.


##### [3] Are the results of the model in line with experimental data? If not, what could be the reason? Think of at least one explanation. Try to test it with simulations (you will get bonus points for that, your explanation does not need to be correct, but should be logical).

state['R'] <- medians[medians$time == 0,]$Free_receptor

# Change the duration of the model with time points from experimental data
times <- unique(MPL$time)

# Change dosis concentration parameter (D) for 0.1 dosis
median_MPL_01 <- median(MPL$MPL_conc[MPL$dose==0.1], na.rm=T)

```

The results of the model are not in line with experimental data, but this differs between the plots. The free receptor plots (both doses) are somewhat similar of that of the model, except for one outlier at a time of 50. The mRNAr plots show way less similarities, where the experimental line fluctuates a lot. 

This may be caused by the structure of the data. Firstly, the data is divided in a strange way. In the beginning there are a lot datapoints and at a higher time less. Secondly, there are not many datapoints per time unit to reliable fit the data. Lastly, the experimental data may contain some bias due to measurement errors or other factors that can influence the concentration of mRNAr or free receptor.

## Assignment 2: simulate scenarioâ€™s

[1] What would be the time course concentration of the activated drug-receptor complex if there was no auto-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor, i.e. if there was not effect of drug on the synthesis of the receptor mRNA? What formula needs to be changed? Adjust the model, run the simulation and plot the results to find out.

```{r}
library(deSolve)

mRNA.dynamic <- function(t, state, paramters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, paramters)),{
    dmRNAr <- ks.Rm * (1 - DR.N / (IC50.Rm + DR.N)) #- k.dRm * mRNAr
    
    dR <- k.sR * mRNAr + Rf * k.re * DR.N - k.on * D * R - k.dR * R
    
    dDR <- k.on * D * R - k.T * DR
    
    dDR.N <- k.T * DR - k.re * DR.N
    
    list(c(dmRNAr, dR, dDR, dDR.N))
  }) 
}

                IC50.Rm = 26.2,
                k.on = 0.00329,
                k.T = 0.63,
                k.re = 0.57,
                Rf = 0.49,
                k.dR = 0.0572,
                k.dRm = 0.612,
                k.sR = 3.22,
                D = 20 * 1000 * 1/374.471 )

state <- c(mRNAr = 4.74,
           R = 267,
           DR = 0,
           DR.N = 0)

times <- seq(0, 48)

out <- ode(y = state, times = times, func = mRNA.dynamic, parms = parameters)
plot(out, las = 1)
```

[2] What is the time course of receptor and mRNA concentrations when the drug treatment is stopped? So After the steady state is reached (at time t_steady), D should be set to zero and the simulation should continue from time t_steady till the new steady state is reached (t_steady_second). Run the simulations and plot the results from t = 0 till t_steady_second.

```{r}
library(deSolve)

mRNA.dynamic <- function(t, state, paramters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, paramters)),{
    dmRNAr <- ks.Rm * (1 - DR.N / (IC50.Rm + DR.N)) - k.dRm * mRNAr
    
    dR <- k.sR * mRNAr + Rf * k.re * DR.N - k.on * D * R - k.dR * R
    
    dDR <- k.on * D * R - k.T * DR
    
    dDR.N <- k.T * DR - k.re * DR.N
    
    list(c(dmRNAr, dR, dDR, dDR.N))
  }) 
}

parameters <- c(ks.Rm = 2.90,
                IC50.Rm = 26.2,
                k.on = 0.00329,
                k.T = 0.63,
                k.re = 0.57,
                Rf = 0.49,
                k.dR = 0.0572,
                k.dRm = 0.612,
                k.sR = 3.22,
                D = 20 * 1000 * 1/374.471 )

state <- c(mRNAr = 4.74,
           R = 267,
           DR = 0,
           DR.N = 0)

t.steady <- seq(0, 35)
t.steady.second <- seq(35, 100)

out.steady <- ode(y = state, times = t.steady, func = mRNA.dynamic, parms = parameters)
parameters['D'] <- 0
out.steady.second <- ode(y = state, times = t.steady.second, func = mRNA.dynamic, parms = parameters)
