# Introduction

Glucocorticoids (GC) are a type of steroid hormones which are used by the immune system to repress inflammation. For this reason GCs are used as a medicine to treat inflammation in inflammatory diseases like asthma. The anti-inflammatory process caused by GCs can be divided into two processes: trans-repression and trans-activation. In trans-repression some inflammatory genes are suppressed by binding of the GCs to GC receptors (GR). This causes histon deacetylation of these genes and this causes for less transcription. In trans-activation the GRs activate transcription of anti-inflammatory genes by binding to DNA recognition sites on these genes. This activation is achieved by histon acetylation.

Using a model


# Method
Below a flow diagram and the differential equations of glucorticoide receptor dynamics describe the model. First data from an experiment is compared with simulation data, to asses model validity. Then results of a change in the model or modelparameters are compared to a basic scenario.

## Assignment 1: assess model validity

[1] Why is it best practice to plot the median for the experimental data? Explain in your report

The median is less sensitive for possible outliers. If a certain value is very high or very low this does not affect the value of the median. When compared to the mean, for example, this does get affected by an outlier.

[2] How do the results of the simulations depend on the dose and concentration of the drug? Compare the model variables mRNA, R with the experimental data by running the simulations adjusting dosis D and plot these to find the answer.

* mRNAr  
The concentration of mRNAr is influenced by the MPL concentration. When a lower MPL concentration is used the mRNAr is decreasing slower. The DR(N) affects the mRNAr synthesis, this DR(N) concentration is lower when there is less MPL and therefore the mRNAr does not decrease as much. When a higher dosis is used the mRNAr is decreasing more rapidly and a lower end concentration at equilibrium can be seen. This is becuase the medicine can bind to more receptors, which results in more DR and therefore more DR(N). The IC50 value is reached earlier and the mRNAr concentration gets decreased.


* R  
The R concentration decreases less when using a lower MPL concentration. This is due to the fact that there is less MPL to create a MPL-receptor complex, so the R concentration stays high. The opposite can be seen when using a higher MPL concentration. The receptor concentration decreases very fast and has a lower end concentration. This is because there is more medicine to bind to the receptor, resulting in a lower receptor concentration.


[3] Are the results of the model in line with experimental data? If not, what could be the reason? Think of at least one explanation. Try to test it with simulations (you will get bonus points for that, your explanation does not need to be correct, but should be logical).

The results of the model are not in line with experimental data, but this differs between the plots. The free receptor plots (both doses) are somewhat similar of that of the model, except for one outlier at a time of 50. The mRNAr plots show way less similarities, where the experimental line fluctuates a lot. 

This may be caused by the structure of the data. Firstly, the data is divided in a strange way. In the beginning there are a lot datapoints and at a higher time less. Secondly, there are not many datapoints per time unit to reliable fit the data. Lastly, the experimental data may contain some bias due to measurement errors or other factors that can influence the concentration of mRNAr or free receptor.


## Assignment 2: simulate scenarioâ€™s

[1] What would be the time course concentration of the activated drug-receptor complex if there was no auto-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor, i.e. if there was not effect of drug on the synthesis of the receptor mRNA? What formula needs to be changed? Adjust the model, run the simulation and plot the results to find out.

[2] What is the time course of receptor and mRNA concentrations when the drug treatment is stopped? So After the steady state is reached (at time t_steady), D should be set to zero and the simulation should continue from time t_steady till the new steady state is reached (t_steady_second). Run the simulations and plot the results from t = 0 till t_steady_second.

[3] Different corticosteroids show different association rates from receptors (kon) and different dissociation rates (in this model reflected by kre). Assuming the same concentrations of the drug, what is the effect of different values of kon and kre (consider 2 and 5 times increase and decrease of both parameters separately) on the receptor and mRNA dynamics? Adjust kon and kre as below and plot the results of the simulation for each change. Note: Simulations should be run for 4 new values of kon: 0.00329/5, 0.00329/2, 0.00329\*2 and 0.003291\*5. The results should be compared to the basic scenario when kon=0.00329 Separately, simulations should be run for 4 new values of kre: 0.57/5, 0.57/2, 0.57\*2 and 0.57*5. The results should be compared to the basic scenario when kre= 0.57

k.on is the rate of the formation of the medicine-receptor complex  
k.er is the rate of the translocation of the receptor from the nucleus to the cytosol

* mRNAr when k.on is changed  
When the k.on rate is increased, the mRNAr concentration decreases because k.on causes an increase in medicine-receptor complexes, which in turn increases more medicine-receptor complexes in the nucleus. And this increases leads to reaching faster of the IC50 value, which lowers the mRNAr synthesis. When the k.on rate is decreased, the mRNAr concentration increases because a lower k.on causes an decrease in medicine-receptor complexes, which in turn decreases the amount of medicine-receptor complexes in the nucleus. And this decrease leads to reaching of the IC50 value slower, which increases the mRNAr synthesis. 

* mRNAr when k.er is changed  
When the k.er is increased, the mRNAr concentration increases because the medicine-receptor concentration decreases in the nucleus, which leads to a slower reaching of the IC50 value. If the IC50 is reached slower, the mRNAr synthesis is higher. When the k.er is decreased, the mRNAr concentration decreases because the medicine-receptor concentration increases in the nucleus, which leads to a facter reaching of the IC50 value. If the IC50 is reached faster, the mRNAr synthesis is inhibited. 

* R when k.on is changed  
When the k.on rate is increased, the R concentration decreases because more medicine-receptor complexes are being formed. When the k.on is decrease, the R concentration increases because less medicine-receptor are being fomred.

* R when k.er is changed  
When the k.er rate is increases, the R concentration increases because more receptors are being translocated from the nucleus to the cytosol. When the k.er rate is decreased, the R concentration decreases because less receptort are being translocated from the nucleus to the cytosol.


[4] What would happen if the synthesis of the receptor was completely blocked? Which parameter needs to be put to zero? Adjust the parameter, run the simulations and plot the results.

The ks_r needs to be put to zero, because this is the rate of the receptor synthesis

(mRNAr is being discusses last)

* R  
The Receptor concentration decreases, because no more receptor is being synthesised.

* DR  
The medicine-receptor complex decreases, becuase no more receptors are available for the medicine to bind to form medicine-receptor complexes

* DR(N)  
The nucleus medicine-receptor complex decreases, because the DR concentration also decreases. This also results in less medicine-receptor complexes in the nucleus

* mRNAr  
The mRNAr concentration increases, when the receptor synthesis stops. This is because, as previously described, the DR(N) decreases. This will never reach the IC50 value, and therefore the mRNA synthesis is always 'on'.

[5] What is the dynamic of the system when the baseline rate of production of mRNA of the receptor is increased or decreased 2 or 5 fold (recalculate the rate of mRNA degradation so that the steady-state assumption at baseline (without the drug) is still valid, i.e. mRNA levels are constant when there is not drug)? Mind you: ks_Rm values should be changed, but we know that if without the drug the system is at steady-state then kd_Rm = ks_Rm/Rm0. Therefore if we change ks_Rm we need to change kd_Rm as well. Also after we recalculate the value of kd_Rm for the baseline conditions, the simulations should be run with drug present. Simulations should be run for 4 different scenarios:

* ks_Rm = 2.9/5 and kd_Rm=2.9/5/4.74
* ks_Rm = 2.9/2 and kd_Rm=2.9/2/4.74
* ks_Rm = 2.9\*2 and kd_Rm=2.9\*2/4.74
* ks_Rm = 2.9\*5 and kd_Rm=2.9\*5/4.74

The graphs above are all with respect to the normal condition. This means that all of the graphs are substracted from the normal condition, and the graphs show the difference when compared to the normal condition.

* mRNAr   
When there is a 2 or 5 fold decrease in ks.Rm, there is a lower rate synthesis of mRNAr. At the same time the rate of degradation also decreases, this leads to a higher mRNAr concentration. However, after some time the steady state (compared to the basic scenario) is reached, even though the rate of synthesis and degradation decreases. 
When there is a 2 or 5 fold increase in ks.rm, there is a higher rate of syntesis of mRNAr. At the same time the rate of degradation also increase, this leads to a lower mRNAr concentration. However, it appears as if the 2 or 5 fold increase doesn't have a huge effect compared to the basic scenario. Furthermore after some time the same steady state has been reached. 

* R  
To continue the mRNAr discussion, the R concentration is directly influenced by the mRNAr concentration. So when there is a 2 or 5 fold decrease in synthesis and degradation rate of mRNAr, which leads to a higher mRNAr concentration, there is also more R. Similarly, when there is a 2 or 5 fold increase in synthesis and degradation rate of mRNAr, wich leads to a lower mRNAr concentration quicker, there is also a lower R concentration. 

* DR  
More R concentration leads to more medicine-receptor complexes, and a less R concentration leads to less medicine-receptor complexes. 


* DR(N)  
More medicine=receptor complexes will be transferred into the nucleus when there is a higher R concentration. However when there is a lower R concentration leads to less transportation of medicine-receptor complexes in the nucleus.
